      <p>This bear will maul any idiot that would ever want to intrude on your
       living space, it needs at LEAST 4 humans a day to survive so make sure to go
       get some at your local grocery store when they are unpacking, they never expect it!</p>
    </li>
    <li> <img src="img/flamingo-costume" alt="flamingo">
      <p>This flamingo has been banshied by his own kind, we are not quite sure why,
         we do know he needs a home though! surprisingly this little dude really loves bacon,
         flamingos are normally omnivores but this guy could fool you that he is a carnivore!
         also some crazy lady came in asking for him and he didnt want to go, there
         might be some baggage with this one. </p>
      </li>
      <li> <img src="img/CC-Catfish" alt="cat"
        <p> this guy would be a perfect addition to your crazy cat lady collection!
          his hairballs are known to be quite large so make sure you have the proper equipment.
          this dude also enjoys the water much more than most cats, he will tread like
          crazy if you put a knight toy in the water with him! </p>
